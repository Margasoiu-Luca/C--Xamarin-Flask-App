# Xamarin App

The purpose of this application is to set up a daily diet with certain foods in the aims of helping people to lose weight.

This is done by using a local Flask/Python/SQLite3 api together with a third party api called [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), that searches for recepies based on a specified query.

The app contains the following features: the ability to create accounts, login into accounts, the ability to search for food recepies based on a query, the ability to see certain details of said foods, the ability to add foods to a "diet", the ability to see your daily diet information on the foods on the diet, and remove foods from a diet.
